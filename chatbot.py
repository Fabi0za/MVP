Customers who have a tax residence outside of Germany are obliged to determine and pay the applicable taxes themselves. Please note that Scalable Capital cannot provide tax advice in this regard. If you have any questions regarding your individual tax situation, please contact your tax advisor or your tax office.\n\nYou can find the amount of withholding tax paid by you in your personal customer area. To do this, please log into your Scalable Capital account on our website, open the menu item "Profile" and click on "Taxes".\n\nPlease note that crypto ETPs classified according to ยง23 are not subject to capital gains tax.

This change will, for example, increase exemption orders in the amount of 801 euros for individuals to 1,000 euros. The decimal places of the exemption order will be rounded up by 24.844% after rounding. Thus, an exemption order of 500 euros is changed to 625 euros instead of 624.24 euros.
